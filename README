SHAPEMapper_v1.2_SER 

 #SHAPEMapper_v1.2_SER is a modified version of ShapeMapper /ref[http://www.chem.unc.edu/rna/software.html], 
 it allows to generate reactivity profiles for single end sequenced reads.

#Requirements:
===================================================================================
This version is implemeted under python 2.7

===================================================================================
matplotlib (python module required for .pdf figure rendering) - 

    Download source
    Extract to any directory
    cd to the extracted directory
    run the command "python setup.py install --user"

===================================================================================
httplib2 (python module only required if rendering structures) - 

    Download httplib2-0.7.6.tar.gz (or later version)
    Extract to any directory
    cd to httplib2 directory
    run the command "python setup.py install --user"

===================================================================================

#Run SHAPEMapper_v1.2_SER:
===================================================================================
Execution instructions:

 Extract files to any directory
 Build the C and C++ modules:
        cd to the ShapeMapper directory
        run the command "make"
        
Add sequence alignment files  to output/aligned_reads/
Add reference sequence files to output/fasta_file/
run the command: ShapeMapper.py

Parameters are modified using the configuration file 'Shape.cfg'

===================================================================================

#Output description and troubleshooting:
===================================================================================

The folder "output"  will hold the  pipeline output.

-Parsed and simplified alignments are written to output/mutation_strings/

-Mutation counts and sequencing depths are written to comma-separated files in
output/counted_mutations/

-SHAPE reactivity files (.shape) are written to output/reactivity_profiles/
-Tab-separated column files containing per-nucleotide depths, total mutation rates, 
reactivities, and standard error estimates are written to .tab files in 
output/reactivity_profiles/
-SHAPE-MaP reactivity files (.map) are written to output/reactivity_profiles/
These are the same as SHAPE files but contain 2 additional columns: standard error
and nucleotide sequence.
-Reactivity profile images and sequencing depth images are written to .pdf files in
output/reactivity_profiles/
Check the depth image to troubleshoot.
    If using directed primers (i.e. not random priming):
        The depths should be flat or very nearly so on a log scale plot
        (Unfortunately log scale is currently disabled because of a matplotlib
        bug). Bumpy depths indicate off-target primer binding, something the 
        pipeline is not currently set up to handle. A workaround in this case is 
        to increase the minLength config option to ensure that all reads included 
        in the analysis completely cover the desired region.
    If using random primers:
        Regions of low depth are undesired. For some RNAs with pockets of low GC
        content, the distribution of coverage can be improved by using specially 
        designed random primers. See the supplemental information in the first
        SHAPE-MaP publication for details.
-Images of histograms of mutation rates, sequencing depths, and reactivities are 
written to .pdf files in output/reactivity_profiles/
